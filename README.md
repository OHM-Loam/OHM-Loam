# OHM Loam

Photography and visual practice by Chris Webster.

## Philosophy

The work embraces minimalism, patience, and the pursuit of subtle connection. Every image is a study in observation, light, and restraint.

> OHM Loam is a reflection of time, practice, and the quiet pursuit of perfection that cannot be taught, only experienced.
